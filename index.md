### About me
I am studying at AGH University of Science and Technology (First year of Computer Science (AI specialization) ðŸ’»)
When I was in high school I participated in many math contests, but after some time i decided that the best way for me is to develope my programming skills. Right now I can connect two of my passions. And that is why I am here! 


# Projects
